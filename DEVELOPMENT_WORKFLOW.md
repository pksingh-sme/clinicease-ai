# ClinicEase AI - Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the ClinicEase AI project to ensure consistent and efficient collaboration among team members.

## Prerequisites

Before starting development, ensure you have:

1. Node.js 18.x or higher installed
2. PostgreSQL database access
3. Git installed and configured
4. Code editor (VS Code recommended)
5. GitHub account with access to the repository

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/clinicease-ai.git
   cd clinicease-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate
   
   # Run database migrations
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Daily Development Workflow

### Starting Work on a New Feature

1. **Sync with the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards outlined in this document
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages

4. **Run tests and linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

5. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR from your feature branch to `develop`
   - Add appropriate reviewers
   - Fill out the PR template

### Code Review Process

1. Reviewers check for:
   - Code quality and readability
   - Adherence to coding standards
   - Test coverage
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications

2. Address feedback:
   - Make requested changes
   - Respond to comments
   - Re-request review if significant changes are made

3. Merge after approval:
   - Squash and merge for clean history
   - Delete the feature branch

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
3. Use descriptive variable and function names
4. Follow functional programming principles when possible
5. Use async/await instead of callbacks
6. Handle errors appropriately

### React/Next.js

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Follow the component composition pattern
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for props
4. Implement proper error boundaries
5. Optimize performance with useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo
6. Use Next.js conventions for routing and data fetching

### CSS/Tailwind

1. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
2. Follow the utility-first approach
3. Create reusable components for common UI patterns
4. Use consistent spacing and typography
5. Implement responsive design

### Database (Prisma)

1. Use Prisma Schema for database modeling
2. Follow naming conventions for tables and columns
3. Use proper data types and constraints
4. Implement indexes for frequently queried fields
5. Use transactions for related operations

## Testing

### Test Structure

1. Unit tests for individual functions and components
2. Integration tests for API routes and database operations
3. End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- src/components/Button.test.tsx

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Writing Tests

1. Use Jest for unit and integration tests
2. Use React Testing Library for component tests
3. Use Cypress for end-to-end tests
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test both happy paths and error cases

## Database Migrations

### Creating Migrations

1. Update the Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Generate the migration:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name
   ```

3. Review the generated SQL in the migration file
4. Test the migration locally

### Applying Migrations

1. In development:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

2. In production:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## Deployment

### Development Environment

1. Changes to `develop` branch deploy to staging environment
2. Automated tests run on each push
3. Manual testing should be performed before merging to `main`

### Production Environment

1. Changes to `main` branch deploy to production
2. Create a release branch for final testing
3. Tag releases with semantic versioning

## Security Considerations

1. Never commit sensitive information to the repository
2. Use environment variables for secrets
3. Validate and sanitize all user input
4. Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. Keep dependencies up to date
6. Follow HIPAA compliance guidelines for healthcare data

## Performance Optimization

1. Use code splitting for large components
2. Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
3. Optimize database queries
4. Use caching appropriately
5. Minimize bundle size
6. Implement proper error handling to prevent crashes

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Use structured logging
2. Implement error tracking
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Set up alerts for critical issues
5. Regularly review logs and metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependency conflicts**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Database connection issues**:
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify database is running
   - Test connection with database client

3. **Build errors**:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### Getting Help

1. Check documentation and README files
2. Review recent commits and PRs
3. Ask team members for assistance
4. Create an issue if it's a bug or feature request

## Communication

1. Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
2. Use Pull Requests for code reviews
3. Use team communication tools for real-time discussion
4. Document important decisions in the code or README

This workflow ensures consistent development practices and smooth collaboration among team members.
