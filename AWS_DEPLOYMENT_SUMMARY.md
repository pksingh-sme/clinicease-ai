# ClinicEase AI - AWS Deployment Summary

This document summarizes all the files and folders needed for deploying ClinicEase AI on AWS, along with the cleanup that has been performed.

## Cleaned Files and Directories

The following unnecessary files and directories have been removed from the repository:

1. `clinicease-ai/` - Duplicate project directory
2. `.next/` - Next.js build artifacts
3. `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` - TypeScript build information
4. `nul` - Empty file
5. Debug pages:
   - `src/app/appointment-debug/`
   - `src/app/debug-upload/`
   - `src/app/demo-profile/`
   - `src/app/logout-test/`
6. Test API endpoints:
   - `src/app/api/test-db/`
7. Console.log statements - Removed from all TypeScript and TSX files

## Files Created for AWS Deployment

The following new files have been created to support AWS deployment:

1. `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive AWS deployment guide using ECS
2. `AWS_ELASTIC_BEANSTALK_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Alternative deployment using Elastic Beanstalk
3. `AWS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - AWS architecture diagram and component descriptions
4. `AWS_STEP_BY_STEP.md` - Detailed step-by-step deployment instructions

### Deployment-Specific Files

```
├── Dockerfile                   # Container configuration
├── .dockerignore                # Docker ignore patterns
├── task-definition.json         # ECS task definition
├── .ebextensions/               # Elastic Beanstalk configuration
│   ├── environment.config       # Environment variables
│   └── healthcheck.config       # Health check configuration
└── src/app/api/health/route.ts  # Health check endpoint
```

## Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be configured in AWS:

1. `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
2. `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
3. `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Secret for NextAuth.js
4. `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Public URL of your application
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Public site URL
6. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key
7. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe publishable key

## AWS Services Required

### Primary Deployment (ECS)
1. Amazon ECS - Container orchestration
2. Amazon ECR - Container registry
3. Amazon RDS - PostgreSQL database
4. Application Load Balancer - Traffic distribution
5. AWS Certificate Manager - SSL certificates
6. AWS Secrets Manager - Secure environment variables
7. Amazon VPC - Network isolation
8. Amazon CloudWatch - Monitoring and logging

### Alternative Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk)
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Application hosting
2. Amazon RDS - PostgreSQL database
3. AWS Certificate Manager - SSL certificates (optional)
4. Amazon Route 53 - DNS management (optional)

## Security Considerations

1. All sensitive environment variables are stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Database is in a private subnet with restricted access
3. Application runs with minimal required permissions
4. SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
5. Regular security updates for dependencies

## Performance Optimization

1. Application is containerized for consistent deployment
2. Health checks ensure high availability
3. Load balancing distributes traffic
4. Caching can be added with ElastiCache
5. CDN can be added with CloudFront for static assets

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. CloudWatch logs provide detailed application insights
2. Health checks monitor application status
3. Automated backups for database
4. Easy scaling options for traffic increases
5. Blue/green deployment strategy for updates

## Cost Estimation (Approximate)

### Minimum Viable Deployment
- EC2 (t3.micro): $8/month
- RDS (db.t3.micro): $15/month
- Application Load Balancer: $20/month
- ECR Storage: $1/month
- CloudWatch: $5/month
- **Total: ~$49/month**

### Production Deployment
- EC2 (t3.small): $15/month
- RDS (db.t3.small): $30/month
- Application Load Balancer: $20/month
- ECR Storage: $2/month
- CloudWatch: $10/month
- **Total: ~$77/month**

*Note: Prices vary by region and usage. Reserved instances can reduce costs.*
